style="margin-left:20px;text-align:left;max-width:40rem"><h1>A Case for Data Lyricism</h1><section id="preface" style="font-style:italic"><p>During these weird times, I’ve stepped back from actively working and sunk down deep into a lot of reflection… About many things, a component of which has been my work and why I do it.</p><p>A label, a title, which are devices seemingly necessary for hiring purposes can often flatten the human motivation behind the work (that is, where a motivation exists, as many people in our unequal society work out of necessity rather than on what they’re interested in). I’ve tried here to articulate what that is in rough terms for me. Whether there’s still a place for me in the ‘employable marketplace’ is an open question, as I feel that since I first started in this field it has evolved from an area of passion, artistic exploration and activism into one of skills-for-hire and professionalisation. However I still hold out hope that there are like-minded folks out there who believe in the emotive potential of data and will keep releasing those sparks out into the world.</p></section><p>As a kid, I understood how frustrating it was not to be able to communicate. When I was 6, my parents had decided to move us across the world to a country where I didn’t know the language or the culture. I was thrown into a situation in which the ease of expressing myself to my peers and others in the world around me, an ability that comes naturally to most children, had been taken away.</p><p>Because of this deprivation, I’ve developed a fascination with communication. Specifically, how things are communicated, how it is understood, what are the dominant modes and practices of that communication and what alternative methods are overlooked.</p><p>One area that does a great job of communicating to you via your emotions is advertising. Advertising taps into your emotions and attaches them to a brand, so that the next time you encounter that brand you are uncannily, subconsciously drawn to it. However, consuming advertising is like talking to someone who doesn’t really believe what they’re saying, even though they’re doing a very convincing job of it. They draw connections between ideas that you wouldn’t necessarily come to yourself in order to make you believe something they want you to believe.</p><p>Advertising and creative expression are unfortunately, in the capitalist society we live in, a dominant way we experience creative expression. Sometimes this is relatively innocuous, a logo design that communicates brand values, or letting an artist produce their work for the brand without exerting influence in order to borrow the ‘coolness’ of the art. But often it is manipulative, a contortion or glossing over of reality. Cleaning up environmental crimes with greenwashing, oil companies using images of fields and nature etc etc.</p><p>These days many brilliant creative minds are forced to make a living in advertising, because that is one of the rare environments in corporate culture where creative practice is encouraged and you can get paid for it. Advertising has co-opted creative expression, it has co-opted the practice of persuasion.</p><p>However, I’m interested in how you can persuade with facts. How you view that word &#x27;fact&#x27; may depend on your concept of ‘objective truth’, but for the sake of progressing the discussion lets focus on the data that is robust, fairly irrefutable in its method of sourcing, (although arguably no source is 100% free of potential flaws). To take something that is observed in reality (which often is still vulnerable to the deficiencies of human observation), and communicate it to others in a meaningful way.</p><p>Before we traverse into the possibilities of this persuasive art, we have to first trudge through the minefield of data, power and the inherit flaws of human nature.</p><p>One possible step in the process where things can go ary when dealing with data is in how it&#x27;s measured. What we measure often flattens out what matters and what doesn’t. This can set our eye lines on the wrong things, it can also illuminate overlooked treasures. Measuring is a blunt instrument, data collection is only one part of the process, but we’ve become hoarding squirrels in relation to data, collecting nuts for winter, rarely digging them up for nourishment (but more on that later).</p><p>Collecting data, as observations of phenomena in the world, can be a violent act. The worldly essence that is what is attempted to capture may evaporate at the moment the record is made. A photograph can only capture an exact moment in time and never again. How do we the breathe life back into this plain number on a page?</p><p>It would be naive to presume that information we encounter doesn’t trigger an emotional response. The issue with advertising and propaganda is that we don’t have ownership over that response. But we desperately look for and seek out meaning and context. How does this piece of information fit into the giant jigsaw puzzle of my understanding of the world. In the interest of ‘impartiality’, educators, governments and media organisations often present information in the rawest, unfiltered way possible, This is often a good thing, you present people with the facts so that they can decide for themselves, but often it comes at the expense of potential context they could have gained. There is so much ‘raw data’ that exists now in the world, so much accumulated observation in human history available to us, it is almost naive to presume that you can present this in a way that your average non-superhuman can easily derive any meaning from it. So we have to look to cues, modes of expression that convey meaning, context, trigger an emotional response.</p><p>All this may be found if we went about the world relying on our senses, but that ship has long sailed. However we are still left with the problem that political boundaries that influence elections are literally drawn based on these observations that we call data. Our lives and futures are at stake in having a true sense of things.</p><p>One negative example of the way a lack of meaning and context affects the world is in when facts are memorised by rote. This happens in school, often a sign that the teaching is inadequate to the needs of the learners. Memorised concepts without understanding, without feeling them to be true, means you’re potentially regurgitating some one else’s agenda. This is why trust is important, and can often be a shorthand in what sources you use to obtain your information. But clearly in the current age of information, even traditional news media, what once was widely trusted by a majority of the population is looked at with disdain and skepticism from people who choose to get their news from alternative sources that are often misleading. Some of this suspicion is legitimate, if you see the funding models that fuel news orgs in the age of the internet and the incentives to please advertising and even governments (and having worked within this machine, let me tell you it ain&#x27;t pretty).</p><br/><br/><p>This is the deficiency I want to address in my work. How do you make people comprehend information, feel it in their bones, feel it to be true to them. Not by dictating the answers, but by making what significance that is there more obvious. This is hard work, it requires creativity, and is so vast in its potential. it is deeply fascinating to me. This comes with immense responsibility, the things I take on have to first be understood and filtered by my human brain. I have to believe that this thing is worth sharing, that the source of this information is legitimate, that someone hasn’t made these facts up in order to manipulate the understanding of truth. So I have to carry that with the work I take on, I have a responsibility to the things I create. I have a responsibility to refuse projects that aren’t meaningful to me, or seem suspect in their motivation. If something I’m asked to do triggers a discomfort in my belly, I have to listen to that because my Human Emotional Response System has been triggered for some reason that requires investigating. That feeling in my belly can be an ok reason to turn something down.</p><p>You take that same feeling in your belly to transform that piece of information, to show the world why you care about it. This is the practice of data lyricism, an expressive, emotional act of communicating information. This is a very human act, actually quite distant and almost contradictory to how technology is applied these days, which often is used to abstract away the human elements. I have felt misunderstood for a long time in my career because people have presumed technology was the point  for me. I’m not a code monkey for hire who can make cool graphs appear out of thin air. Technology enables me to communicate, to express myself. I have no particular interest or obsession in the tooling. At the moment it is the most convenient and expedient way to do my work.</p><p>With that also comes the potential to  express yourself beyond the screen. Can you convey facts with a piece of string (yes, Quipus)? Can you convey facts in origami (I haven’t seen this in action yet but boy do I want to)? All this is a very big thing to ask of someone, but that is the work. It is not, “draw me a pretty picture of my data”, or “make a scrolly thing to go with this text”, you are asking a human to understand what is going on with the information you have provided, and transform it in a way that turns on a lightbulb in people’s brains, in the same way it did for you as the data artist.</p><p>How can you take something that you have observed about your world, and make it something that other people can feel? That is what is interesting to me about communication. That was the task that the 6 year old me had realised was ahead of her, not being able to express her frustrations, her sadness, her sense of loss and sense of possibility, to her new classmates at her new school in her new country.</p></div><a href="/">Go back to the homepage</a></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/datalyricism/";/*]]>*/</script><!-- slice-start id="_gatsby-scripts-1" -->
